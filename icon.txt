IMPORTANT: Plugin Hub Requirement
===================================

This plugin requires an icon.png file in the root directory for submission to the RuneLite Plugin Hub.

Requirements:
- File name: icon.png
- Location: Root directory of the plugin (same level as build.gradle)
- Dimensions: Recommended 64x64 pixels or 128x128 pixels
- Format: PNG with transparency support
- Content: Should represent the plugin's functionality (e.g., an eye with a slash through it, a hidden monster icon, etc.)

The icon will be displayed in the RuneLite Plugin Hub and in the plugin configuration panel.

To create the icon:
1. Design a simple, clear icon that represents "hiding monsters"
2. Save it as icon.png in this directory
3. Ensure it's a square image (equal width and height)
4. Use transparency for the background if desired

Without this icon.png file, the plugin submission to the Plugin Hub will be rejected.
